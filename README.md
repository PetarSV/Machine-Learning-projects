It is necessary to make a classification of data that represent the coordinates of movement with a computer mouse in the format (x, y, .t). The sequence of motion is given as a sequence of such parameters from the beginning of the motion to the end.

Use the known classification data given to you in the "mouse_data.txt" file as the basis for the classification. The data set consists of 3 inputs. Before each sequence of movements you have the name of the person from whom it is made, as well as the ordinal number of the data.

You need to make a classification of the test set given in "mouse_prediction.txt", in one of the four classes (Dushko, Stefan, Filip, Vesna), ie to recognize who made the movements. You enter the solutions in a .csv file which you then need to attach here. You also have an example of such a submission file in the data folder.

Finally, it is obvious that you do not have features in explicit form, but you will have to generate them yourself.
